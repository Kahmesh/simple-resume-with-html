    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As an aspiring Web Developer/Web Designer, I offer a unique blend of IT expertise and a continuous passion for Communications and Design. My heart lies in the dynamic Web Development/Design world and everything IT-related.<br>
        
        I dedicate my free time to self-learning in web development, UI/UX design and upskilling myself with various IT courses such as AI. <br>
        Upskilling myself and taking freelance projects reflects my commitment to staying ahead in this ever-evolving industry.<br>
        Thriving on the perpetual learning curve of the digital age, I am enthusiastic about contributing my passion and dedication to a dynamic communication and marketing team.<br>
        
        Beyond honing my IT and Web Comms skills, you'll find me immersed in fitness, reading and video editing. <br>
        My interests outside of IT and Web Comms keep me sharp as a human, which in turn facilitates me to be better every day.</p>
